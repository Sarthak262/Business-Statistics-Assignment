# Business Statistics Assignment â€“ MSc Business Analytics

This project contains the analysis and results for the **Business Statistics (IB94X0)** individual assignment at Warwick Business School (2024â€“25).

The report is submitted in RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) and rendered as an HTML file. It includes two core statistical investigations:

---

## Question 1 â€“ Cardiovascular Disease in England

We explore which factors â€” including poverty, smoking, overweight, and wellbeing â€” affect the prevalence of cardiovascular disease across local authority regions. Using regression and visual analysis, the report identifies key drivers of CVD and presents a professionally formatted figure highlighting the effect of **poverty**.

---

## Question 2 â€“ Customer Satisfaction

We analyze how factors like delivery times, job satisfaction, SES categories, and new product ranges affect customer satisfaction across stores of a furniture retail company. Special focus is given to the interaction between **delivery times and socio-economic status (SES)** in determining satisfaction levels.
